Fix mobile UI responsiveness for receipt splitter

## Overview
This PR fixes the mobile UI issues identified in #23 by implementing a responsive design for the Assign Items table.

## Problem Statement
The original desktop UI was working well, but the mobile experience had significant issues:
- ❌ Horizontal scrolling required to see all table columns
- ❌ "Assigned To" column extending too far horizontally  
- ❌ Poor readability on mobile devices
- ❌ Fixed minimum widths causing viewport overflow

## Solution
Implemented a responsive design with two distinct layouts:
- **Desktop (768px+)**: Maintains the original table layout
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Card-based layout optimized for touch interaction

## Changes Made

### ✅ Responsive Design Implementation
- Added `md:hidden` and `hidden md:block` classes to show/hide layouts based on screen size
- Implemented card-based mobile layout using existing Card components
- Maintained all functionality across both layouts

### ✅ Mobile-Optimized Layout
- **Card Structure**: Each item is now a separate card on mobile
- **Compact Design**: Reduced button sizes and optimized spacing
- **Text Truncation**: Long item names are truncated with ellipsis
- **Flexible Layout**: Uses flexbox for optimal space utilization
- **Multi-User Support**: Cards remain readable even with many assigned users

### ✅ Technical Improvements
- **Proper Viewport**: Added Next.js 15 compatible viewport export
- **Responsive Buttons**: Smaller buttons with appropriate touch targets
- **Unique IDs**: Separate element IDs for desktop/mobile to avoid conflicts
- **Preserved Functionality**: All popovers, assignments, and editing work identically

### ✅ Code Quality
- **Tests Updated**: Fixed tests to handle dual rendering
- **All Tests Passing**: 70/70 tests pass
- **Linting Clean**: No ESLint warnings or errors
- **Build Successful**: Production build works without issues

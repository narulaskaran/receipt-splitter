## Overview

This PR creates the new `/split` route that can receive and process shared split data from URLs, providing the foundation page for the sharing feature.

## Changes Made

### New Files
- `src/app/split/page.tsx` - Main split page with data retrieval and display
- `src/app/split/error.tsx` - Error boundary for split page failures

### Key Features
- **URL parameter parsing** - Uses split-sharing utilities to decode data
- **Comprehensive error handling** - Graceful handling of invalid/missing data
- **Loading states** - Beautiful spinner and progress indicators
- **Error boundaries** - User-friendly error pages with recovery options
- **Navigation** - Proper back links to main app
- **Basic display** - Placeholder layout for split summary and individual amounts

### Error Scenarios Handled
- Missing or corrupted URL parameters  
- Invalid amounts or malformed data
- Network connectivity issues
- Validation failures

## Testing

- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ New split route compiles and renders correctly
- ✅ Error boundaries handle edge cases gracefully
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types throughout

## Quality Gates

- ✅ All tests pass (`npm test`)
- ✅ ESLint clean (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (`npm run build`)
- ✅ New route appears in build output

## Dependencies

- **PR 1** - Uses serialization utilities for data parsing
- **PR 2** - Uses validation utilities for data integrity

## What Works After This PR

- `/split` route loads and displays basic split information
- Proper error handling for invalid URLs
- Loading states during data processing
- Navigation back to main app
- Foundation for payment functionality (coming in later PRs)
